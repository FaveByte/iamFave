Hello, I'm neoexe01!
I'm a newcomer to the world of coding. I'm currently studying Python and I aim to reinforce what I've learned with practical projects.

Let me tell you a little bit about myself:
I am interested in coding: Learning new technologies and improving myself is a great passion for me.

I'm taking Python classes: I'm actively taking Python classes to improve my programming skills and I'm rapidly progressing in this field.

I am new to coding: Although I am a beginner, I am learning fast.

I plan to present beautiful projects: In the near future, I want to show myself with projects that I will apply what I have learned and share on GitHub.

My goals are

To have a good command of Python programming language.

Gaining experience by working on different projects.

To contribute to open source projects to benefit the community.

I hope to contribute to both myself and other developers by sharing what I have learned on this journey and my projects on GitHub. Let's grow together in the coding world!
